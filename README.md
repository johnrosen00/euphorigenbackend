## Loki’s Loop Handoff Documentation

New Project Owner: Chris Coward, ccoward@uw.edu 

Sponsor was notified about project handoff.

#### Meeting setup:
We set up two meetings, one during week 5 and the other during week 7 to establish a clear timeline of what we can work on for the rest of the project and to talk about what goals we can accomplish. We will demo the project and go over code documentation with Chris during the week 7 meeting. 

### Purpose of Project: 
How might our sponsors achieve an improved escape room so that they can educate the general public about misinformation so they can identify false information?
The purpose of this project is to combat misinformation through gamification. By using gamification in the form of an escape room, we can create a fun and rewarding learning environment to learn about misinformation. 
Another purpose was for each individual in our team to work on a substantial and presentable piece of work. To work in a team, hold meetings to discuss deliverables, work on coding and exploring UI/UX designs were all a part of this project for us to explore. 

### Relevant Research:
Research was mostly done by the research team of this project not associated with the Capstone team. We ran the previous version of the game with a small number of players and found that certain parts of the game were tedious and unfun. Furthermore, everyone seemed to agree that more effort could be used to improve the game’s aesthetics, which could greatly impact how much users enjoy the game.

However, we did work on a literacy review linked below:

### Design & UX Direction:
The game is being redesigned to imitate a real escape room. Previously, the game was played through a laptop inside the game, where players would have to solve puzzles to unlock computer files (more puzzles). We thought that this approach was too mundane and did not like the idea of paying on a laptop within our own laptop. Instead, we decided to rewrite the story to have the game take place in a physical room. The gameplay of the puzzles are kept the same but they now have different themes to represent an object in the room. Instead of using passwords to unlock files, now, passwords are used to unlock the next puzzle which could be an electronic device or a social media account.

As of now, the visual language has not been completely established and the game’s objects are represented with basic geometric shapes drawn on Illustrator. You will have to continue illustrating/adjusting the objects in this room and testing them, although there is not too much to worry about if you keep the puzzle gameplay the same because that has been thoroughly tested already.

### Code:
- Reworked progress saving to use local storage
- Added input boxes so participants can keep track of their progress
- Added narrator text box messages
- Reworked layout for a few puzzles
- Recoded puzzles 1 and 5 to use components and not static images, makes editing easier
- Made and hosted backend that allows for users to log in and tracks metrics for the puzzles
- Made and hosted backend that allows for CIP staff to manage puzzle access passwords as well as view and log player metrics.

We talked to Chris about posting a note on the landing page and he said that there was no need since it would be a smooth handoff to the new owners. Our names are on the “who contributed to project” list as per Chris’ instructions but there is no spot where Chris wanted to have a list of people currently working on the project. 
Chris and our team have notified users about their data being used and are given an option if they want their data deleted. 
We will transfer our cloud infrastructure and code repository ownership to Chris during the week 8, he currently already has access to the cloud infrastructure and code repository.
