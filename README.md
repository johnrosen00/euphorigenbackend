## Lokiâ€™s Loop Handoff Documentation

New Project Owner: Chris Coward, ccoward@uw.edu 

Sponsor was notified about project handoff.

#### Meeting setup:
We set up two meetings, one during week 5 and the other during week 7 to establish a clear timeline of what we can work on for the rest of the project and to talk about what goals we can accomplish. We will demo the project and go over code documentation with Chris during the week 7 meeting.
