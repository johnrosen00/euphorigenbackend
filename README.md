## Lokiâ€™s Loop Handoff Documentation

New Project Owner: Chris Coward, ccoward@uw.edu 

Sponsor was notified about project handoff.

#### Meeting setup:
We set up two meetings, one during week 5 and the other during week 7 to establish a clear timeline of what we can work on for the rest of the project and to talk about what goals we can accomplish. We will demo the project and go over code documentation with Chris during the week 7 meeting. 

### **Purpose of Project: **
How might our sponsors achieve an improved escape room so that they can educate the general public about misinformation so they can identify false information?
The purpose of this project is to combat misinformation through gamification. By using gamification in the form of an escape room, we can create a fun and rewarding learning environment to learn about misinformation. 
Another purpose was for each individual in our team to work on a substantial and presentable piece of work. To work in a team, hold meetings to discuss deliverables, work on coding and exploring UI/UX designs were all a part of this project for us to explore.
